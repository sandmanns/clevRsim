# clevRsim: Simulating clonal evolution


clevRsim provides an R shiny interface for simulation of clonal evolution. The main focus of the tool lies on the realistic simulation of variant calls (point mutations as well as copy number variants) characterizing each clone. The output generated by clevRsim can be directly taken as input to train and test algorithms for variant clustering and clonal evolution tree reconstruction.

## Requirements
To run clevRsim, you need R (Version 4.1.0 or higher) and shiny.

##  Installation
To install clevRsim, just download and execute the global.R script. All required packages will be installed, all functions loaded automatically.
